Things to fix:

* [ ] Hoist dependancies that are needed
* [ ] rename the common-helpers dir to the package name
* [ ] Deal with the note tags at the bottom of examples.
* [ ] Compare the docs and compile diffs to fix
* [ ] Breakout example jsx snippets into components in the docs.
* [ ] Fix repo links in packages to be tree paths - see babel.
* [ ] Fix the website links in the Docs site to point to the readme for that package instead.
* [ ] Edit the header to support multiple package declarations / destructures... (see breadcrumb).
